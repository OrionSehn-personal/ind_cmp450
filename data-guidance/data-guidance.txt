Key stage 2 disadvantage gap index

Filename: ks2_2022_provisional_gapindex_ud.csv
Geographic levels: National
Time period: 2010/11 to 2021/22
Content summary: This file contains data on the key stage 2 disadvantage gap index in England.

Variable names and descriptions for this file are provided below:

Variable name               |  Variable description
--------------------------  |  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
disadvantage_gap_index      |  Disadvantage gap index
total_disadvantaged_pupils  |  Total number of eligible disadvantaged pupils at the end of key stage 2
total_other_pupils          |  Total number of eligible non-disadvantaged pupils at the end of key stage 2
version                     |  The version of the data being presented

Footnotes:

1. Figures for 2022 are based on provisional data. Figures for other years are based on final data.					
2. Disadvantaged pupils are defined as: those who were registered as eligible for free school meals at any point in the last six years, children looked after by a local authority or have left local authority care in England and Wales through adoption, a special guardianship order, a residence order or a child arrangements order. 														
3. Comparisons are made by ordering pupil scores in reading and maths assessments at end of key stage 2 and assessing the difference in the average position of disadvantaged pupils and others. The mean rank of pupils in the disadvantaged and other pupils groups are subtracted from one another and multiplied up by a factor of 20 to give a value between -10 and +10 (where 0 indicates an equal distribution of scores).						
4. Includes only those pupils for whom a valid test level from 3-6 or teacher assessment level from W (working towards level 1) to 6 could be determined in reading, writing and maths from 2011/12 to 2014/15, or maths and English in 2010/11, or for a whom a valid scaled score could be determined in reading and maths in 2015/16 to 2018/19. This number may therefore differ from the total included in national test results which include pupils recorded as A - absent, U - unable to access test.						
5. Data is not available for 2020 and 2021 as assessments were cancelled in these years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Footnotes:

1. Figures for 2022 are based on provisional data. Figures for other years are based on final data.					
2. Includes pupils who have reached the end of key stage 2 in all of reading, writing TA and maths. Excludes pupils with missing or lost test results, and those with a missing writing teacher assessment.					
3. Pupils who meet the expected standard in reading, writing and maths (combined) are those who meet the expected standard in all three subjects. The expected standard in reading and maths is a scaled score of 100 or above. The expected standard in writing is a teacher assessment of 'working at the expected standard' (EXS) or 'working at greater depth' (GDS).					
4. Pupils who reach the higher standard in reading, writing and maths (combined) are those who acheive a scaled score of 110 or more in reading and maths and are assessed as 'working at greater depth' (GDS) in writing TA.					
5. Writing teacher assessment and reading, writing and maths (combined) measures from 2018 onwards are not directly comparable to previous years due to changes in the writing teacher assessment frameworks.					
6. In 2019, gender is not recorded for a small proportion of pupils. Therefore, totals for boys and girls will not always sum to 'all pupils'.					
7. Disadvantaged pupils are defined as: those who were registered as eligible for free school meals at any point in the last six years, children looked after by a local authority or have left local authority care in England and Wales through adoption, a special guardianship order, a residence order or a child arrangements order. 														
8. Following SEND reforms in 2015, SEN pupils were categorised as 'SEN with a statement or Education, health and care (EHC) plan' or 'SEN support'. SEN support replaces school action and school action plus. From 2019, SEN pupils are categorised as 'SEN with an Education, health and care (EHC) plan' or 'SEN support'.														
9. Data is not available for 2020 and 2021 as assessments were cancelled in these years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
10. All gaps and percentage point differences are calculated from unrounded figures
11. Science teacher assessment measures from 2019 onwards are not directly comparable to previous years due to changes in the science teacher assessment frameworks.

Footnotes:

1. Figures for 2022 are based on provisional data. Figures for other years are based on final data.					
2. Pupils who meet the expected standard in reading, writing and maths (combined) are those who meet the expected standard in all three subjects. The expected standard in reading and maths is a scaled score of 100 or above. The expected standard in writing is a teacher assessment of 'working at the expected standard' (EXS) or 'working at greater depth' (GDS).					
3. Pupils who reach the higher standard in reading, writing and maths (combined) are those who acheive a scaled score of 110 or more in reading and maths and are assessed as 'working at greater depth' (GDS) in writing TA.					
4. Writing teacher assessment and reading, writing and maths (combined) measures from 2018 onwards are not directly comparable to previous years due to changes in the writing teacher assessment frameworks.					
5. All figures include LA maintained schools, academies and free schools. Excludes alternative provision and independent schools.											
6. All figures at national, regional and local authority level in the local authority underlying data include pupils with missing results, pending maladministration or where they have taken the test in the past. These pupils are excluded from figures in the national underlying data and national tables. As a consequence of these differences, figures in the national and local authority underlying data may not match.											
7. Figures for Isles of Scilly and City of London are based on a single school in each local authority and therefore figures have been suppressed.											
8. Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole was created on 1 April 2019 from areas that were previously administered by the unitary authorities of Bournemouth and Poole, and the district of Christchurch. 2019 data is not comparable to previous years. Dorset was created on 1 April 2019 from the districts of Weymouth and Portland, West Dorset, North Dorset, Purbeck and East Dorset. 2019 data is not comparable to previous years.											
9. Data is not available for 2020 and 2021 as assessments were cancelled in these years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
10. Users are advised to take care when interpreting writing and science teacher assessment measures and reading, writing and maths (combined) measures for the following local authorities, particularly when making comparisons over time or between local authorities: Barnet, Bath and North East Somerset, Bedford, Blackpool, Bradford, Cambridgeshire, County Durham, Croydon, Cumbria, Darlington, Haringey, Hillingdon, Kent, Lewisham, North Yorkshire, Oldham, Oxfordshire, Peterborough, Rotherham, Sefton, Shropshire, South Gloucestershire, Staffordshire, Stoke-on-Trent, Sunderland, Surrey, Telford and Wrekin, Torbay, Tower Hamlets, West Northamptonshire, West Sussex and Worcestershire. These areas have higher rates of missing teacher assessment in 2022 than other areas - see ‘Data quality’ section for further detail.
11. Science teacher assessment measures from 2019 onwards are not directly comparable to previous years due to changes in the science teacher assessment frameworks.

Footnotes:

1. Figures for 2022 are based on provisional data. Figures for other years are based on final data.					
2. Includes all schools with pupils eligible for assessment at key stage 2. Participation by independent schools is voluntary, therefore the ‘All schools’ figures include results from independent schools that chose to submit data and met the requirements for assessment and moderation.					
3. Includes pupils who have reached the end of key stage 2 in all of reading, writing TA and maths. Excludes pupils with missing or lost test results, and those with a missing writing teacher assessment.					
4. Pupils who meet the expected standard in reading, writing and maths (combined) are those who meet the expected standard in all three subjects. The expected standard in reading and maths is a scaled score of 100 or above. The expected standard in writing is a teacher assessment of 'working at the expected standard' (EXS) or 'working at greater depth' (GDS).					
5. Pupils who reach the higher standard in reading, writing and maths (combined) are those who acheive a scaled score of 110 or more in reading and maths and are assessed as 'working at greater depth' (GDS) in writing TA.					
6. Writing teacher assessment and reading, writing and maths (combined) measures from 2018 onwards are not directly comparable to previous years due to changes in the writing teacher assessment frameworks.					
7. In 2019, gender is not recorded for a small proportion of pupils. Therefore, totals for boys and girls will not always sum to 'all pupils'.					
8. Primary schools includes schools where lowest statutory age < 7 and highest statutory age = 11.										
9. Junior schools includes schools where lowest statutory age >= 7 and highest statutory age = 11.										
10. Other includes schools where highest statutory age > 11 such as all-through schools.										
11. Other Christian Faith includes schools of mixed denomination or other Christian beliefs (e.g. Greek Orthodox).										
12. Data is not available for 2020 and 2021 as assessments were cancelled in these years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
13. All gaps and percentage point differences are calculated from unrounded figures
14. Science teacher assessment measures from 2019 onwards are not directly comparable to previous years due to changes in the science teacher assessment frameworks.					
15. Includes mainstream schools only
